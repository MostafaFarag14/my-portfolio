        <p className="lead">Hi, my name is Mostafa Farag. I'm a graduate of Ain shams computer engineering 
        and past 3-months Cloud intern at ITI in which I learnt basic concepts of Cloud and Devops tools. 
        Recently I learnt React and built a few apps using it. Also, I became familiar with node and express. 
        In college, I built most of the projects using C++ and practiced python in Deep Learning Specialization at Coursera.
